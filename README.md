## Introduction
The advanced SQL project for an e-commerce database involves creating, managing, and analyzing a comprehensive set of data tables to facilitate in-depth data analysis, customer insights, product performance evaluation, and anomaly detection. The project includes several key tables, such as Products, Categories, Customers, Orders, OrderDetails, Payments, Returns, Reviews, and ProductPreferences. This database schema allows for robust data operations, supporting the needs of an e-commerce business in tracking inventory, order status, customer preferences, and more.
