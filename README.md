## Introduction
The advanced SQL project for an e-commerce database involves creating, managing, and analyzing a comprehensive set of data tables to facilitate in-depth data analysis, customer insights, product performance evaluation, and anomaly detection. The project includes several key tables, such as Products, Categories, Customers, Orders, OrderDetails, Payments, Returns, Reviews, and ProductPreferences. This database schema allows for robust data operations, supporting the needs of an e-commerce business in tracking inventory, order status, customer preferences, and more.

INNER JOIN (
    SELECT CustomerID, MAX(OrderDate) AS LatestOrderDate
    FROM Orders
    GROUP BY CustomerID
) AS RecentOrders
ON o.CustomerID = RecentOrders.CustomerID AND o.OrderDate = RecentOrders.LatestOrderDate;

```
By Using CTE
``` SQL
with cte as (
select customerid,max(orderdate) as recent_date  from orders
group by customerid)
select o.customerID,o.orderid,o.orderdate
from orders o
join cte on o.customerid = cte.customerid
where o.orderdate = cte.recent_date;
```

## 7. Identify products that have never been sold.
``` SQL
SELECT p.ProductID, p.ProductName
FROM Products p
LEFT JOIN OrderDetails od ON p.ProductID = od.ProductID
WHERE od.ProductID IS NULL;
```
## 
8. Calculate the return rate for each product
``` SQL
with cte as (
SELECT o.productid,count(o.orderid),count(r.returnid),
count(r.returnid)/count(o.orderid) *100 as return_rate
FROM orderdetails o
left JOIN RETURNS R
ON o.orderid = r.returnid
group by o.productid)
select cte.productid,p.productname,cte.return_rate
from cte 
join products p
on p.productid = cte.productid;
```

## 9.Get the list of customers along with their most preferred product.

``` SQL
with cte as (
select pp.customerid,p.productname from productpreferences pp
join products p
on p.productid = pp.productid
where PreferenceScore = 1)
select cte.customerid,concat(c.firstname,' ',c.lastname) as name,cte.productname
from cte 
join customers c
on c.customerid = cte.customerid;
```

## 10. List all orders along with the payment status
``` SQL
select *,case when paymentid is not null then "paid" else "pending" end as payment_status
from (
select o.OrderID,o.customerid,o.orderstatus,p.paymentid from orders o
left join payments p
on p.orderid = o.orderid) a
